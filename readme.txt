This is 'Guess the number game'. In this program the computer will choose a random number from 1 to 100.
And you have to guess the number in as much attempts as you want. The most less attempt in which the number 
is guessed will be the new highscore and will be stored in highscore.txt till anyone breaks the highscore.
